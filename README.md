# Atari Breakout Clone 

I created this Atari Breakout Clone in just a little over 24 hours as practice using C++ and OpenGL for games development. 

This version was made possible by [Joey De Vries' Tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout). A lot of the code in this project is very similar to the code given in the linked tutorial since it makes no sense to try rewriting functional code just for the sake of it. I have gone through and added comments to the code to make it easier to understand and give myself reference points for what functions are used for if anyone uses this project to develop anything else.



### How to Run
To run the program please download the repo (or just the executable) and run the executable when available (!!!!!!!this will be added later!!!!!!!). Please note that the executable has been produced for OSX only. For other operating systems, please download the repo and compile from source for your system 



It is worth noting that the project was developed in Xcode and as such there are a few quirks to the setup if you wish to edit the code yourself. First of all, you will need the following libraries/frameworks

- glad 
- glfw
- freetype
- irrklang 
- glm

Files for these libraries and functions are listed in more detail inthe `.gitignore` file.



###  .gitignore contents:
- XCode build files
- GLM header files
- GLAD implementation files
- stb_image header and implementation files 
- IrrKlang header files
